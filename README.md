Magic Squares - Siamese Method
The Siamese method, or De la Loubère method, is a simple method to construct any size of n-odd magic squares 
(i.e. number squares in which the sums of all rows, columns and diagonals are identical). 
First, an arithmetic progression has to be chosen (such as the simple progression 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 for a square 
with three rows and columns (the Lo Shu square)).
Then, starting from the central box of the first row with the number 1 (or the first number of any arithmetic progression),
the fundamental movement for filling the boxes is diagonally up and right (↗), one step at a time. When a move would leave 
the square, it is wrapped around to the last row or first column, respectively.
If a filled box is encountered, one moves vertically down one box (↓) instead, then continuing as before.
